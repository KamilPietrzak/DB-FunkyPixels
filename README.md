## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About Funky Pixels
Funky Pixels is social platform project, created to share humorous multimedia content.

The idea for this project comes from an initiative that me and my friends took in high school. Unfortunately, due to lack of skills and experience, the project was terminated after three years of work and was never completed. Because I enjoy fixing things that don't work properly, and I find it an interesting challenge, I decided to try again after more than a year and a half break.

It is worth remembering that the project was prepared for educational purposes, with some simplifications, and is not intended to create a real product.</p>
